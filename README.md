These repository contains my private ansible scripts to play with the hadoop "ecosystem" (hdfs,yarn,hbase,spark...).

The project is _WORK IN PROGRESS_. Not for public use. It's just a (public) archive.

All of the ansible roles requires the downlad and unpack of the softwares to the specified directories (from apache or other distributions).
